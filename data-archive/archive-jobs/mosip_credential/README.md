# Archival Jobs
The Jobs will archive the data from the **credential_transactions** table in mosip_credential db to the table in archive database.

## Pre-requisite steps:

1. If we don't have mosip_archive DB than go ahead and continue with the [db_scripts](../../../data-archive/db_scripts)
2. Once we have the mosip_archive DB ready we need to continue with the archive_jobs.
3. Install python3.9 virtual env.
4. Switch to virtual env.
5. Install required psycopg dependency. `sudo yum install python3-psycopg.


## Archive jobs based on status code (Recommended):
Run the following command to run the archive jobs based on status code
    
```
sh mosip_archive_credential_table_base-on-status-code.sh
```
Note:- To archive the table based on status_code make sure
the required status codes are added to the configuration in [mosip_archive_credential.ini](mosip_archive_credential.ini).

 Set the status code to archive the data as below:
 
 ```credential.endstatus.list=STORED,printing```

Above property will archive the mosip_credential table data based on the status code.

```credential.status.time.map=ISSUED:2,FAILED:7```

Above property will archive the mosip_credential table data based on the status code and number of days after the records were created (cr_dtimes column).

## Archive jobs based on no of days after the records were created:
Run the following command to run the archive jobs based on no of days after the records were created (cr_dtimes coulmn)

```
sh mosip_archive_credential_table_base-on-no-of-days.sh
```
Set the no of days to archive the data in [mosip_archive_credential.ini](mosip_archive_credential.ini) file.

```archive_older_than_days = 7```
